# UART

This project contains the verilog code for transmitter part of the UART module.
The testbench writen in System Verilog.
the netlist was generated using the Cadence incisive and xcelium tools 
the overall  Code coverage was 74.91 %
The timing report 
The area report 
The power report 
Finally the Equivalence Checking was performed
